You can use an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Mule IDE to rapidly develop Mule ESB applications. For more information on the Mule IDE, see the #[Mule IDE User Guide]#.

Usually, you simply attach the `src.zip` file that comes with the Mule distribution to the Mule JARs in your project so you can browse the source code while developing your classes. If you want to build Mule from source, see the following topics in the Mule Developer's Guide:
