Mule 3 introduces an application-level component model to Mule. With this new concept, there is now a well defined model for packaging your applications and deploying them into a Mule instance. In addition, Mule provides support for managing the lifecycle of applications, even supporting multiple applications running independently within the same Mule container. This allows additional advantages such as:

* Running multiple applications side-by-side
* Clear boundaries for operations on what a Mule application is
* New or modified applications can be deployed/undeployed with zero downtime
* Mule can monitor your applications and will reload configuration changes automatically
* Applications can depend on different library versions, even if they would conflict before
* Multiple versions of an application can exist side by side

Understanding the new model can be divided into several topics:
