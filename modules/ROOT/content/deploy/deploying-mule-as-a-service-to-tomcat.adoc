This page describes how to install Mule as a service in Apache Tomcat and set up your Mule applications for hot deployment. For more information on hot deploying Mule applications, see xref:deploy/application-server-based-hot-deployment.adoc[Application Server Based Hot Deployment].

== Installing Mule in Tomcat

To install Mule in Tomcat so that you can hot deploy your Mule applications, you take the following steps:

. http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi[Download] and install Apache Tomcat 6 from the Apache web site following the standard installation instructions.
. In the Tomcat home directory, add the following line to the `conf/server.xml` file: +
`<Listener className="org.mule.module.tomcat.MuleTomcatListener" />`
. Copy the contents of the Mule `lib` folder with all its subdirectories *except* `/boot` to the `mule-libs/` directory under your Tomcat home directory (create one if necessary). You do not need to flatten the directories.
. Copy the `mule-module-tomcat-<version>.jar` file to the `mule-libs/mule/` directory under your Tomcat home directory (if it is not there already).
. Copy the following libraries from your Mule `lib/boot/` directory to your Tomcat `mule-libs/opt/` directory:
* `jcl104-over-slf4j-1.5.0.jar`
* `log4j-1.2.14.jar`
* `slf4j-api-1.5.0.jar`
* `slf4j-log4j12-1.5.0.jar`
. In the Tomcat `conf/catalina.properties` file, add the following to `common.loader` (precede with a comma to separate it from existing values): +
`${catalina.home}/mule-libs/user/*.jar,${catalina.home}/mule-libs/mule/*.jar,${catalina.home}/mule-libs/opt/*.jar`

== Copying the Mule Application Files

After you package your configuration files and custom Java classes in a WAR file (see xref:deploy/application-server-based-hot-deployment.adoc[Application Server Based Hot Deployment]), copy your Mule applications WAR files to the Tomcat `/webapps` directory.

== Hot Deploying Mule Applications

After you have copied the WAR file for your Mule application to the Tomcat `/webapps` directory, Tomcat deploys it. If you need to make a change to a configuration or Java file in the webapp, simply modify the file in the exploded directory under the Tomcat `/webapps` directory, and then touch the `web.xml` file (or you can simply add and delete a space in the file and then save it) to trigger Tomcat to redeploy the application. Alternatively, you could modify the source files, repackage them as a WAR, and drop the new WAR into the `/webapps` directory to trigger Tomcat to redeploy the application.
