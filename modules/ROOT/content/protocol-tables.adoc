In addition, since TCP and SSL are stream-oriented and Mule is message-oriented, some application protocol is needed to to define where each message begins and ends within the stream. The table below lists the built-in protocols, describing:

* The XML tag used to specify them
* Any XML attributes
* How it defines a message when reading
* Any processing it does while writing a message

[%header,cols="5*"]
|===
|XML tag |Options |Read |Write |Notes
|<tcp:custom-class-loading-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly , maxMessageLength, classLoader-ref |Expects the message to begin with a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Precedes the message with a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Like the length protocol, but specifies a classloader used to deserialize objects
|<tcp:custom-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, class, ref |varies |varies |Allows user-written protocols, for instance, to match existing TCP services.
|<tcp:direct-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly |All currently available bytes |none |There are no explicit message boundaries.
|<tcp:eof-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly |All bytes sent until the socket is closed |none |
|<tcp:length-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly , maxMessageLength |Expects the message to begin with a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Precedes the message with a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |
|<tcp:safe-protocol |rethrowExceptionOnRead, payloadOnly , maxMessageLength Expects the message to begin with the string "You are using SafeProtocol" followed by a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Expects the message to be preceded by the string "You are using SafeProtocol" followed by a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Precedes the message with the string "You are using SafeProtocol" followed by a 4-byte length (in DataOutput.writeInt() format) |Somewhat safer than the length protocol because of the extra check. This is the default if no protocol is specified.
|<tcp:streaming-protocol |rethrowExceptionOnRead |All bytes sent until the socket is closed |none |
|<tcp:xml-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead |A message is an XML document that begins with an XML declaration |none |The XML declaration must occur in all messages
|<tcp:xml-eof-protocol> |rethrowExceptionOnRead |A message is an XML document that begins with an XML declaration, or whatever remains at EOF |none |The XML declaration must occur in all messages

Protocol attributes:

[%header,cols="4*"]
|===
|name |values |default value |notes
|class |The name of the class that implements the custom protocol |  |See xref:transports/tcp-transport-reference.adoc[below] for an example of writing a custom protocol
|classLoader-ref |A reference to a Spring bean that contains the custom classloader |  |
|maxMessageLength |the maximum message length allowed |0 (no maximum ) |A message longer than the maximum causes an exception to be thrown.
|payloadOnly |true |If true, only the Mule message payload is sent or received. If false, the entire Mule message is sent or received. |Protocols that don't support this attribute always process payloads
|ref |A reference to a Spring bean that implements the custom protocol |  |
|rethrowExceptionOnRead |Whether to rethrow exception that occur trying to read from the socket |false |Setting this to "false" avoids logging stack traces when the remote socket is closed unexpectedly
