By default Mule filters out some internal class references from stacktraces to produce a more readable output. This behavior can be controlled one of three ways:

* Command-line arguments

* Setting properties in Mule Studio

* Using JMX

== Command-Line Arguments

Two command-line properties let you control this behavior using `-M-DpropertyName`:

* `mule.stacktrace.full` - When present, Mule does not filter stacktraces. Intended for Mule developers only, end users probably never need to enable this. (You can also use the property `mule.verbose.exceptions=true`, with the same result.)

* `mule.stacktrace.filter` - A comma-separated list of packages and/or classes to remove from the stacktraces, which are matched via `string.startsWith()`.

== Setting Properties in Anypoint Studio

In Studio, you can set the same properties specified above to instruct Mule to provide either unfiltered stacktraces or to configure a particular filter of packages or classes to remove. To adjust these settings, open your `mule-project.xml` file and define environment variables to specify the behavior you want. In the example below, the `mule.stacktrace.full` property is set to *true*.

== Using JMX

The Configuration MBean now exposes two new options:

* `FullStackTrace` - Same as above

* `StackTraceFilter` - Same as above

[NOTE]
====
These settings are shared between apps even though each app has its own configuration MBean. That means that modifying it in one app  affects others.
