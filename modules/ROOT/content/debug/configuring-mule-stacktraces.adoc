By default Mule will filter out some internal class references from stacktraces to produce a more readable output. This behavior can be controlled one of three ways:

* command-line arguments

* setting properties in Mule Studio

* using JMX

== Command-Line Arguments

Two command-line properties enable you to control this behavior using `-M-DpropertyName`:

* `mule.stacktrace.full` - when present, Mule will not filter stacktraces. Intended for Mule developers only, end user would probably never need to enable this.

* `mule.stacktrace.filter` - a comma-separated list of packages and/or classes to remove from the stacktraces (matched via `string.startsWith() )`

== Setting Properties in Mule Studio

In Studio, you can set the same properties specified above to instruct Mule to provide either unfiltered stacktraces or to configure a particular filter of packages or classes that should be removed. To adjust these settings, open your mule-project.xml file and define environment variables to specify the behavior you want. In the example below, the **mule.stacktrace.full* property is set to *true**.

== Using JMX

The Configuration MBean now exposes two new options.

* FullStackTrace - same as above

* StackTraceFilter - same as above

[NOTE]
====
These settings are shared between apps even though each app has its own Configuration MBean. That means that modifying it in one app will affect others.
