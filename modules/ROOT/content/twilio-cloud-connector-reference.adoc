*Purpose:* The Twilio Cloud Connector enables a Mule application to build voice applications and send SMS messages.

*Minimum Configuration:* The configuration reference, Config reference, is set to a Twilio global element that you have previously set up in Mule Studio. For the Twilio global element, you need Twilio account authentication credentials (AccountSid and AuthToken) to access the Twilio REST API.

*Discussion:* You must have created a Mule Studio global element for the Twilio cloud connector. You can do so from the Global Element pane prior to dropping the Twilio Cloud Connector on the canvas. Or, you can create the global element from within a Twilio Pattern Properties dialog when setting the config reference property.

Set the Config reference and Operation properties from the General tab in the Pattern Properties dialog:

* Select the Twilio global element for the configuration reference from the Config reference pull-down list. If you have not yet created a Twilio global element, click the Add button to do so. (See <<Twilio Global Element>>.)
* Select a Twilio operation from the Operation pull-down list. Operations correspond to the available Twilio REST APIs.

After you select an operation, the bottom half of the screen displays the properties that can be set for the selected operation. (Properties for "Add incoming phone number by phone number" are shown above.)

Properties marked with a red x are required. Properties not marked with a red x are optional.

Where it can do so, Mule Studio provides property default values. You can change any such default value. Notice that the query Statement is marked with a red x indicating it is required.

== Twilio Global Element

Click the Add button next to the Config reference field in the Pattern Properties dialog to create a Twilio global element. (You can also do this from the Global Elements pane.) If you have selected a Twilio global element from the Config reference pull-down list, you can click the Edit button to modify configuration values in that global element.

You enter the Twilio authentication information in the global element properties. The authentication properties must be configured.
