= Installing a Commercial License

Unless you use an evaluation version of Mule, you need to install a commercial license in Mule to use Mule ESB.

If you cluster Mule instances, the license you install must enable clustering. The commands you use to install, uninstall, or verify a license that enables clustering are the same as those for a license that does not enable clustering.

To install your commercial license in Mule (and automatically replace the evaluation license), please run the following command from your $MULE_HOME/bin directory:

----
mule -installLicense ~/license.lic
----

[NOTE]
The original license.lic file should automatically be removed from the system once you complete this step. Remove an old license manually by deleting $MULE_HOME/conf/muleLicenseKey.lic prior to starting the license installation.


If you are installing your license on multiple platforms, be sure to back up the license.lic file in another location before running this command.

Here is what the command line/shell output will look like:

-----
mule -installLicense ~/license.lic
Usage: ./mule { console | start | stop | restart | status | dump }
No command specified, running in console (foreground) mode by default, use Ctrl-C to exit...
