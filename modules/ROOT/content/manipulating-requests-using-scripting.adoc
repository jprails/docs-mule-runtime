You can write Java code to interact with Mule. This example introduces using scripting in Mule. Scripting is a powerful way to manipulate requests and create custom logic. The benefit of scripting is that you can use different languages in Mule namely, http://www.groovy-lang.org/[Groovy], Ruby (using http://jruby.org[JRuby]), Python (using http://jython.org[Jython]) and server-side http://www.mozilla.org/rhino[Rhino] (open-source implementation of JavaScript). The example in this document uses Groovy to transform an incoming message.

== What You  Learn

* Using the Script Transformer and configuring it from Mule Studio
* Embedding script code in your configuration file, removing the need to create an external code file

=== Prerequisites

Ideally, you should be working through these tutorials in sequence and have completed the Invoking a Component Method lesson.

== Running the Example

* Create a scripting transformer configured to use Groovy as the language
* Embed a script in your Mule configuration file to perform a transformation on the incoming request
* The resulting behavior was the same as Working with Transformers except you don't need to create a separate Java class to perform the transformation.
