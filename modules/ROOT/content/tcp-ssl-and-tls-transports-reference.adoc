= TCP, SSL, and TLS Transports Reference

There are two Mule transports that provide access to TCP connections:

The xref:transports/tcp-transport-reference.adoc[TCP Transport], which uses the basic TCP transport. +
The xref:transports/ssl-and-tls-transports-reference.adoc[SSL and TLS Transports], which use TCP with socket-level security. (SSL and TLS are actually two names for the same transport.)

Other than the type of socket used, these transports all behave quite similarly.
