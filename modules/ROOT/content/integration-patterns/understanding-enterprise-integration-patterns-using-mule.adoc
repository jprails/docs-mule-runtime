The Enterprise Integration Patterns are accepted solutions to recurring problems within a given context and they provide a framework for designing, building messaging and integration systems as well as a common language for teams to use when architecting solutions.

Mule supports most of the Enterprise Integration Patterns from the http://www.eaipatterns.com/toc.html[book] by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf.

The fact that Mule implements these patterns greatly reduces the effort required when building integrations. You can design your solution using these well-known patterns and then simply configure and use these same patterns in Mule.

== Mapping Enterprise Integration Patterns into Mule Objects.
