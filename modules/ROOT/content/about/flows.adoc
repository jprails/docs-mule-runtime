A flow is a Mule component that allows you to order Mule event processors in a valid arrangement to automate integration processes. +
A flow is in essence a chain of Event Processors. Typically, a flow starts with an event source. When the event source is triggered, a Mule event is created.

// COMBAK: This flow explanation is not suitable for Mozart users.
// == Flow Configuration
//
// //TODO: Check if the Exception Strategy is the same with the new Error handling
// A Flow is configured in XML using the <flow> element. Each flow has a name attribute, an event source, one or more Event Processors and an optional exception strategy.
//
// *Basic Structure*
//
// [source,xml, linenums]
// ----
// <flow name="">
//     - 0..1 EventSource
//     - 1..n EventProcessor(s)
//     - 0..1 ExceptionStrategy
// </flow>
// ----
//
// == Example
//
// *Simple Book Order Processing Flow*
//
// //TODO: Update this example
// [source,xml, linenums]
// ----
// <flow>
//     <file:inbound-endpoint path="/myDirectory">
//         <file:filename-filter name="*.xml"/>
//     </file:inbound-endpoint>
//     <xml:xslt-transformer xsl-file="bookOrderTransformation.xsl"/>
//     <splitter expression="xpath://order"/>
//     <!-- The following Event Processors will be invoked for each order in the xml file -->
//     <expression-filter expression="xpath://order[@type='book']"/>
//     <component class="org.my.BookOrderProcessor"/>
//     <smtp:outbound-endpoint subject="Order Confirmation" address=""/>
//     <jdbc:outbound-endpoint />
//     <default-exception-strategy>
//         <jms:outbound-endpoint queue="failedOrders"/>
//     </default-exception-strategy>
// </flow>
// ----

When an event is received or generated by the event source the flow starts and the configured Event Processors are invoked in a chain in the same order as they are configured. +
Some Event Processors accept child Event Processor elements, in this case these are processed before returning to the main flow and continuing processing:

If the flow is _request-response_ because an inbound endpoint is defined with a _request-response_ exchange pattern, then the result of the flow execution is returned to the inbound endpoint and then in turn to the callee. +

If there are no _<response>_ blocks in your flow and if none of the configured Event Processors perform any response processing then the response used is simply the result from the last Event Processor in the flow. +
If a _<response>_ block is used, then any Event Processors configured in this element are used to process the response event. Some Event Processors such as CXF perform processing of the response event as part of their default configuration:

[NOTE]
When the last element in the flow configuration is a _one-way_ _<outbound-endpoint>_ there's no result of it's execution so the returned payload of the message is going to be NullPayload. If the _one-way_ _<outbound-endpoint>_ is followed by another processor, it receives as input the same event that the outbound-endpoint receives instead of NullPayload.

Flows can connect and trigger other flows. +
There are two ways of connecting flows:

* Via an endpoint.
* Via a Flow-Ref component.

The first option uses transports (such as HTTP, VM or JMS connectors) to connect the flow to external flows or services while the other connects flows within the mule application.


// COMBAK: Are private flows going to be deprecated?
// == Private Flows
//
// A private flow is one that cannot be accessed from outside the JVM via a xref:3.8@endpoints/endpoint-configuration-reference.adoc[Mule Endpoint] because it has no message source defined.
//
// Private Flows are therefore only used if they are referenced from another construct running in the same Mule instance. When configuring Mule using XML the _<flow-ref>_ element is used to include one flow in another.
//
// A private Flow differs from the use of a "Processor Chain" in that a Flow has it's own context and exception strategy where as when a processor chain is referenced, it is executed in the context of the flow that references it.
//
// *Private Flow Example*
//
// [source,xml, linenums]
// ----
// <flow name="privateFlow">
//   <append-string-transformer message="b"/>
// </flow>
//
// <flow name="publicFlow">
//   <http:inbound-endpoint address="http://localhost:8080"/>
//   <append-string-transformer message="a"/>
//   <flow-ref name="privateFlow"/>
//   <append-string-transformer message="c"/>
// </flow>
