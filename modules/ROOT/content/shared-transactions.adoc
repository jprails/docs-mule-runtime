== Introducing Shared Transactions

One of the strengths of the Mule ESB is its ability to share many kinds of resources with the rest of the software environment: libraries, Spring beans, transaction managers, and many more. Starting in Mule 2.2.6 and 3.0, there's another thing Mule can share: transactions.

== New Attribute interactWithExternal on <xa-transaction>

In JTA, the Java Enterprise Edition API for transaction processing, transactions are tied to threads. When Mule is entered from user code it's possible that a transaction has already been started on the current thread, and Mule might want to join it rather than starting a new (nested) transaction. You can control this with a new, optional boolean attribute on the *<xa-transaction>* element called *interactWithExternal*. The default value is *false*, which make Mule act like it did in previous versions. The way that the two transaction-controlling attributes *action* and *interactWithExternal* combine is straightforward if you keep in mind what the two *interactWithExternal* settings mean:

* true – pay attention to transactions started outside of Mule
* false – ignore transactions started outside of Mule

== Rules on Transaction Sharing

The complete set of rules is below. For simplicity, we call a transaction started by Mule a "Mule Transaction", and a transaction started by user code a "non-Mule transaction".

* action = NONE
** interactWithExternal=true
*** Throw an exception if any transaction is active.
** interactWithExternal=false
*** Throw an exception if a Mule transaction is active..
* action = ALWAYS_BEGIN
** interactWithExternal=true
*** If no transaction is active, begin a new one.
*** Otherwise, throw an exception.
** interactWithExternal=false
*** If no Mule transaction is active, begin a new one. If a non-Mule transaction was active, this new transaction will be nested inside it.
*** Otherwise, begin a new transaction.
* action = BEGIN_OR_JOIN
** interactWithExternal=true
*** If any transaction is active is started, join it.
*** Otherwise, begin a new transaction.
** interactWithExternal=false
*** If a Mule transaction is active, join it.
*** Otherwise, begin a new transaction. If a non-Mule transaction was active, this new transaction will be nested inside it.
* action = ALWAYS_JOIN
** interactWithExternal=true
*** If any transaction is active, join it.
*** Otherwise, throw an exception.
** interactWithExternal=false
*** If a Mule transaction is active, join it.
*** Otherwise, throw an exception.
* action = JOIN_IF_POSSIBLE
** interactWithExternal=true
*** If any transaction is active, join it.
** interactWithExternal=false
*** If a Mule transaction is active, join it.
