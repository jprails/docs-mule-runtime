TCP and SSL are very low-level transports, so the usual tools for debugging their use, for instance, logging messages as they arrive, might not be sufficient. Once messages are being sent and received successfully, things are largely working. It may be necessary to use software (or hardware) than can track messages at the packet level, particularly when a custom protocol is being used. Alternatively, you can debug by temporarily using the direct protocol on all inbound endpoints, since it will accept (and you can then log) bytes as they are received.
