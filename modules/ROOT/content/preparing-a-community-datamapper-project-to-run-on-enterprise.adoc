Mule allows you to develop and preview Anypoint DataMapper-enabled applications with the Studio graphical interface included in both the Community (CE) and Enterprise (EE) editions. However, only the Enterprise edition server can actually run these DataMapper-enabled applications. Therefore, you need to prepare the Datamapper projects you have developed in CE by completing the following tasks:

. Export your project from your CE instance of Mule.
. Import your project into your new EE Mule instance.

== Exporting a Project From Mule CE

. In Mule Studio CE, click the *File* menu, then select *Save*.
. Click the *File* menu again, then select *Export*.
. In the *Export* wizard, click the plus image:add.png[(plus)] or (arrow >) icon to the left of *Mule*.

. Select `Mule Studio Project . . .`, then click *Next*. +

. In the *Export Settings* pane, click the down arrow to the right of the *Project* field, then select the Studio project you wish to export.
. In the *Zip file* field, use the *Browse...* button to specify a location on your hard drive in which Mule will store your exported Studio project. +

. Click *Finish*.
. Optionally, verify the existence of the zip file by navigating to the folder on your hard drive in which Mule saved your project.

== Importing a Project to Mule EE

. If you have not already done so, download http://www.mulesoft.com/mule-esb-open-source-esb#download[Mule ESB Enterprise Edition (with Studio)].
. Follow the included instructions to install Mule ESB Enterprise Edition.
. Launch your new Mule EE instance, which opens the Studio interface.
. Click the *File* menu, select *Import*.
. In the *Import* wizard, click the plus image:add.png[(plus)] (or arrow >) icon to the left of *Mule*.

. Click `Mule Studio generated Deployable Archive . . .`, then click *Next*. +

. Click *Finish* so that Studio imports, then opens the project.
. Right click the name of the flow in your DataMapper project (i.e., `<ProjectName>.mflow`).

Studio runs the application with DataMapper.
