=== Studio

This procedure assumes that you have already launched Mule Studio and have opened a new or existing project. If you have not yet opened your first project in Studio, click *File* > *New* > *Mule Project*, and observe the default value in the *Server Runtime* field in the wizard.

. In the *Package Explorer*, click the expand arrow next to the name of one of your projects to expand the folder.

. Note the *Server Runtime* version in the *Runtime* column at right.
