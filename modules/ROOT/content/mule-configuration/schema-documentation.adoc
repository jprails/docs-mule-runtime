Mule 3.0 was released with new Javadoc-style schema documentation, making it easier to familiarize yourself with all the elements and attributes permissible in xml configuration files.

If you are familiar with versions of Mule older than v3.0, you may want to consult this list of xref:mule-configuration/notes-on-mule-3.0-schema-changes.adoc[schema changes].
