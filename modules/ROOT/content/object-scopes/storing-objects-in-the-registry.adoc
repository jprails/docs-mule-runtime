If you need to store runtime data that is available across the application, you can store the data as objects in the https://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/current/apidocs/org/mule/api/registry/Registry.html[Registry]. You can get a handle to the Registry from anywhere that you have access to the https://www.mulesoft.org/docs/site/current/apidocs/org/mule/api/MuleContext.html[MuleContext], as in most Mule ESB entities. For example, you could store the object as follows:

----
muleContext.getRegistry().registerObject("foo", new MyFoo());
----

You could then update the object from somewhere else:

----
Foo foo = (Foo) muleContext.getRegistry().lookupObject("foo");foo.setBarVal(25);// Replace the previous objectmuleContext.getRegistry().registerObject("foo", foo);
----

This approach is useful for storing an object that is needed by multiple components across your application.
