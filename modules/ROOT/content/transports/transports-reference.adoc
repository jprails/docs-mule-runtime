Following is a list of known transports (also called "providers") for Mule. Some functionality is contained within modules instead of transports--see xref:modules/modules-reference.adoc[Modules Reference]. For more information on transports, see the following topics:

* xref:transports/connecting-using-transports.adoc[About Transports]
* xref:transports/configuring-a-transport.adoc[Configuring a Transport]
* xref:transports/creating-transports.adoc[Creating Transports]

If you have created a transport for Mule and would like to share it with the Mule community, discuss it in the
http://forums.mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Forums].

The following list includes some prominent transports (also known as connectors) that are listed in https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange#!/?types=connector&sortBy=name[Anypoint Exchange].

Note that in Mule 3, CXF and Jersey are no longer classed as transports. They are now modules that use an underlying transport (for instance HTTP or HTTPS) to communicate between client and service.
