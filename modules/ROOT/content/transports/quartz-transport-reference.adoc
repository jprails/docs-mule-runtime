The Quartz transport provides support for scheduling events and for triggering new events. An inbound quartz endpoint can be used to trigger inbound events that can be repeated, such as every second. Outbound quartz endpoints can be used to schedule an existing event to fire at a later date. Users can create schedules using cron expressions, and events can be persisted in a database.

This transport makes use of the http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/[Quartz Project]. The Quartz site has more generic information about how to work with Quartz.

== About Cron Expressions

A cron expression is a string comprised by six or seven fields separated by white space. Fields can contain any of the allowed values, along with various combinations of the allowed special characters for that field. The fields are as follows:

[%header,cols="4*",width=10%]
|===
|Field Name |Mandatory |Allowed Values |Allowed Special Chars
|Seconds |YES |0-59 |, - * /
|Minutes |YES |0-59 |, - * /
|Hours |YES |0-23 |, - * /
|Day of Month |YES |1-31 |, - * ? / L W C
|Month |YES |1-12 or JAN-DEC |, - * /
|Day of Week |YES |1-7 or SUN-SAT |, - * ? / L C #
|Year |NO |empty, 1970-2099 |, - * /
|===

Cron expressions can be as simple as this:
`* * * * ? *`

or more complex, like this:
`0 0/5 14,18,3-39,52 ? JAN,MAR,SEP MON-FRI 2002-2010`.

Following are some examples:

[%header,cols="2*",width=10%]
|===
|Expression |Behavior
|0 0 12 * * ? |Fire at 12pm (noon) every day
|0 15 10 ? * * |Fire at 10:15am every day
|0 15 10 * * ? |Fire at 10:15am every day
|0 15 10 * * ? * |Fire at 10:15am every day
|0 15 10 * * ? 2005 |Fire at 10:15am every day during the year 2005
|0 * 14 * * ? |Fire every minute starting at 2pm and ending at 2:59pm, every day
|0 0/5 14 * * ? |Fire every 5 minutes starting at 2pm and ending at 2:55pm, every day
|===

If you are not familiar with cron syntax, here is a http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-1.x/tutorials/crontrigger[good tutorial].

== About Jobs

Jobs perform an action when a time trigger occurs from the Quartz transport. Mule provides a number of jobs for generating and scheduling events. These are detailed below. You can also write your own jobs and hook them in using the custom-job type included with Mule.

== Connector

The Quartz connector is used to configure the default behavior for Quartz endpoints that reference the connector. Note if there is only one Quartz connector configured, all Quartz endpoints will use that connector.

=== Attributes of <connector...>

[%header,cols="10a,10a,10a,10a,60a"]
|===
|Name |Type |Required |Default |Description
|scheduler-ref |string |no |  |Provides an implementation of the Quartz Scheduler interface. If no value is provided, a scheduler is retrieved from the StdSchedulerFactory. If no properties are provided, the getDefaultScheduler method is called. Otherwise, a new factory instance is created using the given properties, and a scheduler is retrieved using the getScheduler method.
|===

=== Child Elements of <connector...>

[%header,cols="3*",width=10%]
|===
|Name |Cardinality |Description
|factory-property |0..* |Set a property on the factory (see scheduler-ref).

== Outbound endpoint

An outbound Quartz endpoint allows existing events to be stored and fired at a later time/date. If you are using a persistent event store, the payload of the event must implement java.io.Serializable. You configure an org.quartz.Job implementation on the endpoint to tell it what action to take. Mule has some default jobs, but you can also write your own.

== Endpoint

A global endpoint that can be used as a template to create inbound and outbound Quartz endpoints. Common configuration can be set on a global endpoint and then referenced using the @ref attribute on the local endpoint. Note that because jobs sometimes only work on inbound or outbound endpoints, they have to be set on the local endpoint.

== Endpoint polling job

An inbound endpoint job that can be used to periodically read from an external source (via another endpoint). This can be useful for triggering time-based events from sources that do not support polling or for simply controlling the rate in which events are received from the source.

----
<flow name="testService5">  <!--  The endpoint polling Job tries to perform a 'request' on a Mule endpoint. If a result is received, it hands off to the 'testService5' service for processing. The trigger fires every 5 minutes starting at 2 pm and ending at 2:55 pm, every day. During this period, the job checks the file directory /N/drop-data/in every 5 minutes to see if event data is available. The request times out after 4 seconds if there are no files in the directory.   -->    <quartz:inbound-endpoint name="qEP5" cronExpression="0 0/5 14 * * ?" jobName="job5"           connector-ref="quartzConnector1">      <quartz:endpoint-polling-job>        <quartz:job-endpoint address="file:///N/drop-data/in" timeout="4000"/>      </quartz:endpoint-polling-job>    </quartz:inbound-endpoint>    <echo-component/></flow>

== Scheduled dispatch job

An outbound job that will schedule a job for dispatch at a later time/date. The event will get dispatched using the configured endpoint reference.

[%header,cols="3*",width=10%]

|Name |Cardinality |Description
|job-endpoint |0..1 |The endpoint used to dispatch the scheduled event. The preferred approach is to create a global endpoint and reference it using the ref attribute. However, you can also use the address attribute to define a URI endpoint (which supports expressions). You can use the timeout attribute to specify an arbitrary time-out value associated with the endpoint that can be used by jobs that block waiting to receive events.

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<flow name="testService6">  <!--  This outbound Quartz endpoint receives an event after the component has processed it and stores it in the event store.

== Custom job

A custom job can be configured on inbound or outbound endpoints. You can create and configure your own job implementation and use it on a Quartz endpoint. A custom job can be configured as a bean in the XML configuration and referenced using this job.

== Custom job from message

Allows a job to be stored on the current message. This can only be used on outbound endpoints. When the message is received, the job is read and the job is added to the scheduler with the current message. This allows for custom scheduling behavior determined by the message itself. Usually the service or a transformer would create the job on the message based on application-specific logic. Any Mule-supported expressions can be used to read the job from the message. Typically, you add the job as a header, but an attachment could also be used.
