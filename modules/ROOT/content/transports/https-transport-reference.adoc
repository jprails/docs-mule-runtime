The Secure HTTP transport provides support for exposing applications over HTTP and making HTTP client requests from Mule flows to external services as part of event flows. Mule supports secure inbound, secure outbound, and secure polling HTTP endpoints. These endpoints support all common features of the HTTP spec, such as ETag processing, cookies, and keepalive. Both HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 are supported.

== HTTPS Connector

This connector provides Secure HTTP connectivity on top of what is already provided with the Mule xref:3.4@http-transport-reference.adoc[HTTP Transport]. Secure connections are made on behalf of an entity, which can be anonymous or identified by a certificate. The _key store_ provides the certificates and associated private keys necessary for identifying the entity making the connection. Additionally, connections are made to trusted systems. The public certificates of trusted systems are stored in a _trust store_, which is used to verify that the connection made to a remote system matches the expected identity.

== Setting up a HTTPS Server

In order to setup a HTTPS server with Mule a few first steps need to be performed. First a keystore must be created, this can be done using the keytool provided by Java. You can find this in the bin directory of the Java installation. Once located you can then execute the following command to create a keystore:

----
 keytool -genkey -alias mule -keyalg RSA -keystore keystore.jks
----

This will create a file in the local directory called keystore.jks. Ideally this should be created in the MULE_HOME/conf directory if to be used across multiple applications or can be put into the <MY MULE APP>/src/main/resources directory if being used within a single application.

Once the keystore is in place the following needs to be added to your mule configuration file:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<https:connector name="httpsConnector">
     <https:tls-key-store path="keystore.jks" keyPassword="<Your Password>" storePassword="<Your Password>"/>
 </https:connector>
----

If the keystore was in the <MY MULE APP>/src/main/resources directory then you can just specify the name in the path. Otherwise if the keystore was located in the MULE_HOME/conf directory then you will have to specify "$\{mule.home}/conf/keystore.jks" as the path.

== Configuration Reference

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Property |Description
|tls-client a|
Configures the client key store with the following attributes:

* path: The location (which will be resolved relative to the current classpath and file system, if possible) of the keystore that contains public certificates and private keys for identification
* storePassword: The password used to protect the keystore
* class: The type of keystore used (a Java class name)

|tls-key-store a|
Configures the direct key store with the following attributes:

* path: The location (which will be resolved relative to the current classpath and file system, if possible) of the keystore that contains public certificates and private keys for identification
* class: The type of keystore used (a Java class name)
* keyPassword: The password used to protect the private key
* storePassword: The password used to protect the keystore
* algorithm: The algorithm used by the keystore

|tls-server a|
Configures the trust store. The attributes are:

* path: The location (which will be resolved relative to the current classpath and file system, if possible) of the trust store that contains public certificates of trusted servers
* storePassword: The password used to protect the trust store
* class: The type of trust store used (a Java class name)
* algorithm: The algorithm used by the trust store
* factory-ref: Reference to the trust manager factory
* explicitOnly: Whether this is an explicit trust store
* requireClientAuthentication: Whether client authentication is required

|tls-protocol-handler |Configures the global Java protocol handler. It has one attribute, property, which specifies the `java.protocol.handler.pkgs` system property.

For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xmlns:spring="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
      xmlns:https="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/https"
    xsi:schemaLocation="
        http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-current.xsd
        http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/3.0/mule.xsd
        http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/https http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/https/3.0/mule-https.xsd">

    <https:connector name="httpConnector">
        <https:tls-client path="clientKeystore" storePassword="mulepassword"/>
        <https:tls-key-store path="serverKeystore" keyPassword="mulepassword" storePassword="mulepassword"/>
        <https:tls-server path="trustStore" storePassword="mulepassword"/>
    </https:connector>

    <https:endpoint name="clientEndpoint" host="localhost" port="60202"
                    connector-ref="httpConnector" />
</mule>
----

== Polling Connector

The polling connector allows Mule to poll an external HTTP server and generate events from the result. This is useful for pull-only web services. This connector provides a secure version of the `PollingHttpConnector`. It includes all the properties of the HTTPS connector plus the following optional attributes:

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Attribute |Description
|pollingFrequency |The time in milliseconds to wait between each request to the remote http server.
|checkEtag |Whether the ETag header from the remote server is processed if the header is present.
|discardEmptyContent |Whether Mule should discard any messages from the remote server that have a zero content length. For many services, a zero length would mean there was no data to return. If the remote HTTP server does return content to say that the request is empty, users can configure a content filter on the endpoint to filter these messages out.
|===

For example, after defining the HTTP namespace in the header, you could configure the polling connector like this:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<http:polling-connector name="PollingHttpConnector" pollingFrequency="2000" />
----

== HTTPS Endpoints

An inbound HTTPS endpoint exposes a flow securely over HTTPS, essentially making it an HTTP server. If polling of a remote HTTP service is required, this endpoint should be configured with a polling HTTPS connector.

An outbound HTTPS endpoint allows Mule to send requests securely using SSL to external servers or Mule inbound HTTP endpoints using HTTP over SSL protocol.

A global HTTPS endpoint can be referenced by flows.
