This page covers testing options for your Mule ESB projects.

Typically, existing, bundled tests can fill many of your testing requirements. The `src/test/` directory in every Mule ESB maven project incorporates both unit and functional tests. The included maven `tests` project contains additional useful functional and integration tests.

== Types of Testing

You can leverage the following bundled tests when configuring and customizing Mule:

* Unit testing of your simple extensions and customizations
* Functional testing of your Mule configuration and setup
* Functional and unit testing of your custom modules and transports
* Integration testing of multiple modules, transports, and transformers, etc.
* System testing of transports that connect to embedded or external services
* Stress and performance testing

The functional test classes that Mule provides in the `org.mule.tck` and `org.mule.tck.functional` packages facilitate testing of both your Mule system configuration as well as custom modules and transports. For details, see xref:testing/functional-testing.adoc[Functional Testing].

Additionally, the Mule test JAR file contains abstract test cases that enable unit testing of your simple extensions (e.g., `AbstractTransformerTestCase` and `AbstractOutboundRouterTestCase`) as well as your custom modules and transports (e.g., `AbstractConnectorTestCase`, `AbstractReceiverTestCase`, `AbstractDispatcherTestCase`, and `AbstractEndpointTestCase`). For details, see xref:testing/unit-testing.adoc[Unit Testing].

== Performance Tests

After you have ensured that your setup and configuration are correct and that your customizations work correctly, verify that your system is performing as intended. The xref:testing/profiling-mule.adoc[Mule Profiler Pack] can identify memory leaks in your customizations.
