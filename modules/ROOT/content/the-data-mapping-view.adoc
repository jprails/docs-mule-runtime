*_Version 3.3.1 only_*

This document provides an overview of Studio's graphical data mapping editor, *Anypoint* *DataMapper* (referred to as *DataMapper* from this point on).

[TIP]
This document assumes the reader is familiar with the Anypoint DataMapper Transformer. Consult the xref:6@studio::datamapper/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[DataMapper Transformer Reference] document for details.

== Displaying the Graphical Mapping Editor

To see the graphical mapping editor, double-click the *DataMapper* building block in the Mule Studio canvas. Studio highlights the *Data Mapping* tab and displays the editor (see image below).

== Overview of the Graphical Mapping Editor

The image below describes the different icons, indicators and tools in DataMapper's graphical mapping editor. For a description of each item, consult the numbered table below the image.

[%header,cols="2*"]
|===
|Number |Description
|*1* a|
Input pane *Add element* icon. Click to add elements to the mapping, including:

* Rules
* Input Arguments
* Lookup tables

|*2* a|Input pane *Properties* icon. Click to edit properties for the input data.

image::2-input-properties.png[2-input_properties]

|*3* a|Input pane *Search Filter*. Type a string to display only elements in the input data that contain the string.

image::3-input-type-filter-text.png[3-input_type_filter_text]

|*4* a|Input pane *Expand all* and *Collapse all* buttons. Click to expand or collapse all elements in the input pane.

image::4-input-expand-collapse-all.png[4-input_expand-collapse_all]

|*5* a|
Input pane *Eye* icon. Default position is closed.

* When closed,image:eye-closed.png[eye_closed] hides all elements in the input pane that are not mappable in the currently displayed mapping level. (To display different mapping levels, see item *6*.)

* When open,
image:eye-open.png[eye_open] displays all elements in the input mapping pane that are not collapsed, whether or not you can map them in the current mapping level.

image::5-input-eye-open.png[5-input_eye_open]

|*6* a|*Current Element Mapping* indicator/drop-down menu. Indicates the currently-displayed mapping level for multiple-level data mappings such as nested lists. The drop-down menu allows you to instantly switch between mapping levels. The screenshots below illustrate the respective displays of two mapping levels. Note that the solid, dotted, and greyed-out arrows change to reflect the mappings Mule defines for the selected mapping level.

`contacts_to_user`:

`emergencyContacts_to_User`:

|*7* a|*Add Mapping* icon: Click to add a new mapping. DataMapper displays the *Structure mapping editor* pop-up dialogue (see image below).

In the *Name* field, type a descriptive name for the new mapping.

In the *Condition* field, type an XPath condition that should be met by the structure being mapped. The condition will filter the selected source.

|*8* a|The *Edit Mapping* icon. Click to open the *Structure Mapping Editor*.

image::8-example.png[8.example]

Click *Advanced Mapping Editor* to access DataMapper's advanced editor. For a detailed explanation of *Advanced Mapping Editor*, consult xref:6@studio::datamapper/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[DataMapper Transformer Reference].

image::8-example2.png[8.example2]

|*9* |*Remove mapping* icon. Click to remove the currently displayed mapping.
|*10* a|Output pane *Clear field assignment* icon. Click to remove the script assigned to a field in the output mapping. To see the script for a field, click the field. DataMapper displays the script in the editor below the output pane. For example, in the screenshot below, the `name` field's script is `$in.0.name;`.

image::10-example.png[10.example]

|*11* |Output pane *Properties* icon. Click to edit properties for the output data. Identical to the input pane *Properties* icon (see item *2* in this table).
|*12* |Output pane *Search Filter*. Type a string to display only elements in the output data that contain the string. Identical to the input pane search filter (see item *3* in this table).
|*13* |Output pane *Undo* icon. Click to undo your last action in DataMapper.
|*14* |Output pane *Redo* icon. Click to redo your last action in DataMapper.
|*15* |DataMapper *Properties* icon. Click to display, and optionally edit, properties for the DataMapper building block.

image::15-example.png[15.example]

|*16* |The *Eye* icon for the Output pane. Its behavior is identical to the *Eye* icon in the Input pane. See item *5* in this table.
|*17* |Output pane *Expand all* and *Collapse all* buttons. Click to expand or collapse all elements in the output pane.
|*18* a|Output *Mapping Fields*. Studio indicates mapped fields in *bold*, and unmapped fields in _italics_.
In the screenshot below, DataMapper maps the `name` and `lastname` fields, while `phone` is not. Click a mapped field to display its assigned script in the textbox under the Output pane. You can edit the assigned script directly in the textbox, or click the image:open-scrip-editor.png[open_scrip_editor] icon (highlighted below, left) to open the Expression Editor (below, right).

|*19* a|
*Mapping arrows*.

Mapping arrows are black if the graphical editor is currently displaying the arrows' mapping level. (For a details on selecting mapping levels, see item *6* in this table.)

* a *solid* arrow indicates a valid mapping in the current mapping level
* a *dotted* arrow indicates a top-level mapping, such as a mapping between two nested lists
* a *greyed-out* arrow indicates a mapping for another mapping level

|*20* a|*Input pane controls* for adding `Input arguments`, `Rules` or `Lookup tables`. Right-click the appropriate control to add an element to the input data (see image below).

*Input arguments* enable you to include dynamic information, such as the output of Mule variables or functions in your mapping. Consult xref:using-input-arguments.adoc[Using Input Arguments] for details.

*Rules* enable you to dynamically define mappings based on properties of the input data. For a detailed explanation of rules, consult the xref:6@studio::datamapper/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[XPATH Mapping section] of the DataMapper Transformer Reference page.

*Lookup tables* facilitate mappings from one value to another on the basis of lookup table definitions. For details consult the xref:6@studio::datamapper/datamapper-user-guide-and-reference.adoc[Lookup Tables section] of the DataMapper Transformer Reference page.
