*Purpose:* Validates a message against a schema.

*Minimum Configuration:* The path to the XSD schema location.

*Discussion:* The Schema Validation Filter uses the JAXP libraries to validate a message against a schema. You must provide the *path, file name, and extension* of the schema or schemas in the Schema Locations property.

Optionally, you can set Schema Language to the schema language to use. If not specified, the property defaults to http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema[XML Schema].

By default, the Return result box is checked, which caches the result of the XML validation and allows you to read the XML again. If unchecked and set to false, the filter runs more efficiently but does not cache the XML and you cannot read the XML a second time.
