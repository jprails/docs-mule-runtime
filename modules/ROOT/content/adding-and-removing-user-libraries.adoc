Anypoint Studio leverages http://www.eclipse.org/[Eclipse’s] capacity to add and remove user libraries. As an organized set of `.jar` files, a user library provides an easy way to reference files across projects. Rather than individually adding files to a project, create a user library to store `.jar` files, then add the library in your project’s build path.

== Adding User Libraries

Included within Anypoint Studio are several libraries available to add to, then reference in your projects. Follow the procedure below to add a user library to your Studio project.

. In the *Package Explorer* pane in Studio, right-click the name of your project.

. Select *Build Path*, then **Add Libraries...**
