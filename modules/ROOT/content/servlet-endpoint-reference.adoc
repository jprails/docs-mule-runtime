*Purpose:* Allows Mule applications to listen for messages or events received via a Servlet request.

*Minimum Configuration:* The path to the Servlet.

*Discussion:* At a minimum, you specify the path to the Servlet through which the event or message is received. The Path property is set from the General tab.

The *Servlet Endpoint Properties* pane contains four tabs, as detailed below:

== General Tab
