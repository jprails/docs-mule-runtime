The Try scope allows you to handle errors that may occur when attempting to execute its child components. It allows you to set a fine grained configuration to a specific part of your flow with a certain error-handling strategy. It also distinguishes different error types, and can apply different behaviors accordingly.




== Handling Transactions

You configure a Try Scope so that it treats its child operations as an indivisible transaction. A transaction is a series of actions that should never be partially executed, errors should lead to either a rollback or a commit.

The Try scope can be set to treat the components within it as a transaction. It can be configured in the following ways:

* *Ignore* (default)
+
Actions aren't treated as a transaction, errors cause no rollbacks or commits.

* *Always Begin*
+
A new transaction is started every time the scope is executed.

* *Begin or Join*
+
Only relevant in cases where execution order may vary (for example due to asynchronous actions happening outside the flow). If the current processing of the flow has already begun a transaction, join it. Otherwise, begin a new one.
