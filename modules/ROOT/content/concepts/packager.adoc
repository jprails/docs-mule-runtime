When packaged into a binary deployable file, every Mule application has two types of descriptors:

* Application Descriptor.
:: This file describes how your application is composed. +
Your application has two descriptors:
+
** A pom.xml file.
** A mule-application.json file.

* Application Dependency Descriptor.
:: This file describes all the dependencies required by the package to work properly. +
The dependency descriptor in the Mule packaged application is the pom.xml file.

There are two types of packages:

* Heavy Package
:: Contains the application and all its dependencies whether those be JAR files required by the application or by its plugins.
* Lightweight Package
:: The application package declares its dependencies so that the other components obtain the JAR files.

When developing a Mule Application, your project has a folder structure that changes after being packaged into a deployable application.
