A Choice flow control component follows the structure described below.


* A single root element `<choice>`
* A `<when>` child element for each routing option, each with an expression to match.
* Optionally, an `<otherwise>` child element of choice, that handles all cases where none of the expressions on the `<when>` elements evaluate to True.
* Components that are conditionally executed under each of the choices are defined as child elements of the `when` and `otherwise` elements.
