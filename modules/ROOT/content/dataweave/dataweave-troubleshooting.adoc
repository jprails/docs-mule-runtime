This document lists common error messages, what these mean and how to resolve them.

== Cannot coerce :binary to :object

It means that DataWeave is trying to transform a binary value to an object, which isn't allowed.

*Cause*: One possible case is that DataWeave is reading the content as binary as it was an 'InputStream' or 'Byte array' and its *mime type* is not set.
In this scenario DataWeave defaults to Java reader. If you look at the Info log it would display something like this:

----
MimeType was not resolved '*/*' delegating to Java.
----

*Solution* : Validate that the *mimeType* is set.
For example verify that if your data source has a `mime-type` field, its value is set, or if the value is set through a set-payload or set-variable component, then the `mime-type` property was defined in it.

== Cannot coerce :string to :object

It means that DataWeave is trying to transform a string value to type object.

*Cause*: Same as <<Cannot coerce :binary to :object>>, this may be a mime-type problem.

*Cause*: If the value is an XML, this may be caused by an empty tag. By default the XML reader reads

Take the following example:

.Input
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<user></user>
----

.Transform
[source,dataweave]
----
payload.user.name
----

The above script fails with the error *Cannot coerce :string to :object*

*Reason*: As you can see the input xml is an empty xml tag, so the expression *payload.user* returns an empty string. Then DataWeave tries to apply the 'name' selector over a string, which raises an exception.

*Solution*: The XML reader has a configuration property named 'nullValueOn'. This property can be set to "blank" or "empty", which can fix this issue. To set this property see xref:6@studio::transform-message/input-output-structure-transformation-studio-task.adoc[To Define Input and Output Structure of a Transformation].
