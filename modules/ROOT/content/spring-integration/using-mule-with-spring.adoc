Mule leverages the Spring framework for developing Java applications. Mule ESB 3.3 supports the latest version of the framework, Spring 3.1, making use of the Eclipse-based development environment.

*xref:3.6@about/xml-configuration-file.adoc[About the XML Configuration File]* +
The most common way to configure Mule ESB is with Spring XML files that use custom Mule namespaces. +
Use one of the two namespaces in your spring framework schema in Mule:

* http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.1.xsd
* http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-current.xsd

*xref:3.6@spring-integration/spring-application-contexts.adoc[Spring Application Contexts]* +
Mule offers several options for creating and managing Spring application contexts for your application.

* Single application context
* Multiple application context
* Existing application context
* Existing application context as parent

*xref:3.7@spring-integration/using-spring-beans-as-flow-components.adoc[Using Spring Beans as Flow Components]* +
Build Spring beans to define component behaviors which Mule applications can reference.

*Spring Bean Definition Profiles* +
Mule’s configuration file takes advantage of Spring 3.1's ability to create *bean definition profiles*. You can use Spring bean definition profiles to register different beans for different target environments, instead of using one bean for all target environments. Refer to http://blog.springsource.org/2011/02/11/spring-framework-3-1-m1-released/[Spring’s blog posting] for more information about bean definition profiles.
