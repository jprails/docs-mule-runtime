This guide offers information about how to use Mule Runtime, commonly called Mule, or Mule ESB to integrate systems, orchestrate web services and configure the runtime environment.

== About Mule

Mule is a lightweight integration runtime engine that powers Mule applications. +
Rather than creating multiple point-to-point integrations between systems, services, APIs, and devices, you use Mule to create applications that manage message routing, data mapping, orchestration, reliability, security, and scalability between nodes.

The runtime defines the rules for how event data is handled in an application. +
Mule applications receive events, process them and route them to other endpoints.

[NOTE]
Mule is so named because it “carries the heavy load” of developing an infrastructure that supports multiple applications and systems both flexibly and intelligently.

Developing with Mule You Can...

* Deploy or integrate applications or systems on premises or in the cloud
* Employ out-of-the-box connectors to create SaaS integration applications
* Build and expose APIs
* Consume APIs
* Create Web services which orchestrate calls to other services
* Create interfaces to expose applications for mobile consumption
* Integrate B2B with solutions that are secure, efficient, and quick to build and deploy
* Shift applications onto the cloud
* Connect B2B e-commerce activities
