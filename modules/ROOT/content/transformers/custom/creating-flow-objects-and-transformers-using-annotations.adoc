Annotations now allow flow objects to be created using purely annotations on the flow component. Additionally, there is a new annotation for creating Mule transformers that makes it much easier to define and discover custom transformers.

== Assumptions

This page assumes you are familiar with Java annotations (marked with an @). For a brief overview of annotations, see the  http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/[Java annotations tutorial].

== Annotations for Flow Components

Annotations will especially help if you're using flow components, where annotations provide request injection capabilities. This means you can define what data to read from the incoming methods, similar to dependency injection for runtime.

When you have a request to your component, what kind of things can you inject? You can inject message payload, then transform that into an object. You can also inject message headers, attachments, perform actions on payload (using xpath annotation to describe the node you want to get from the incoming document). This reduces the amount of xml you need to create for your configuration, because you can now put it all in the component. This makes your configuration a lot cleaner.

== Annotations for Transformers

Mule 3.0 also introduces a new annotation for creating Mule transformers that makes it much easier to define and discover custom transformers.

Until now, creating transports for Mule required a good deal of XML, even though the most important thing you wanted to see was probably where the data came from and where it went. The new annotation in Mule 3.0 removes the need for some of the xml config required to define a new transport.

[TIP]
When using Parameter annotations remember that every parameter needs to be annotation for the method invocation to work.
