Mule supports the notion of configuration patterns that are specialized flow tailored to serve a very specific purpose in the least amount of XML.

For a list of configuration patterns that ship with Mule, see xref:using-mule-configuration-patterns.adoc[Using Mule Configuration Patterns].

Mule also provides the necessary tooling for creating a pattern catalog and patterns within it, allowing teams to encapsulate domain specific knowledge in custom configuration elements and share it across teams.

In essence, a pattern catalog is not different than a standard module: teams sharing pattern catalogs will only need to add a new dependency in their pom.xml. Of course, unlike what it's done with Mule standard modules, the dependency scope will have to be "compile" and not "provided."
