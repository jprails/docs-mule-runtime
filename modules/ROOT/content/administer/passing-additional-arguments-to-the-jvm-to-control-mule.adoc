The Wrapper provides several properties you can set as described in the article on http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org/doc/english/properties.html[Java Service Wrapper].

If you want to pass additional arguments to the JVM that will run Mule, you can add `wrapper.java.additional.n` entries to the `wrapper.conf` file in the `/conf` directory under the Mule installation directory, or you can pass the arguments at the command line by adding the `-M` switch.

For example, to set Mule's encoding, you could add `wrapper.java.additional.1=-Dmule.encoding=ISO-8859-1` to the Wrapper configuration file, or you could add `-M-Dmule.encoding=ISO-8859-1` to the Mule script at the command line. Note that if you add `wrapper.java.additional.n` entries to the configuration file, you must change each instance of `n` to a consecutive number, or Java will not parse the properties correctly.
